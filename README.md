# Boeva_lab_project
This repository contains some of the scripts used in the context of the semester project 'Assessing the stability of differential expression analysis under clustering errors in scRNA-seq' conducted in Boeva Lab (ETHZ, D-INFK) under the supervision of PhD student Florian Barkmann.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our ability to understand cellular diversity
at unprecedented resolution by delving into the expression profiles of individual cells. In the
context of scRNA-seq data analysis, two crucial steps for extracting meaningful biological insights
from the pre-processed count matrices are clustering and differential expression testing.
This project aims at investigating the critical link between these two steps, evaluating the robustness of commonly used differential expression testing (DEA - Differential Expression Analysis) methods to various extents of clustering errors.
